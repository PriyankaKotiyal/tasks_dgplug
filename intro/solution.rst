My name is Priyanka Kotiyal.I am a second year student pursuing B.Tech with stream Computer Science Engineering from Dr.B.C.Roy Engineering College, Durgapur.My hometown is Kolkata which is in West Bengal, India.

Its my pleasure to be a part of Kushal Das's dgplug Summer Training-2013.I have got to know about several things which are as follows :-

1. git- a distributed version control and source code management (SCM) system

2. vim -Vim is designed for use both from a command line interface and as a standalone application in a graphical user interface. Vim is free and open source software.

3.Python -Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

This training is really great and useful.It helps us to enhance our skills not only in programming but in other applications too
